Welcome to my personal website!
======
## Who am I?
My name is Savva Balashov.\
I am a junior software developer at ISS and a staff member of Moscow Power-Engineering Institute. \
Currently I am writing my master's thesis on SISR (single image super resolution) topic.\
I write mostly in C++. I also have upper-basic/intermediate knowledge about CUDA C++, C#, Java for Android Development, LAMP stack and Assembly languages. 
------
## What is it for?
This website is created to represent my CV in net and to embrace me to write about software development from Junior's perspective (Middle, Senior and PhD one day, hopefully).\
If you have any questions, you can write me using contacts from this site.
